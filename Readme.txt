Welcome to the Monty Hall Problem for Nintendo DS!

It's a programe I made alone, in one month. If you want to play it or to see / edit the code (I don't see why you could have downloaded it else, but anyways...), see the sectiond below.

PLAY

 - If you want to play it on a DS-family console, you need to have an hacked 3DS/2DS/DSi or a flashcard (M3, R4...).
   Simply copy the file in your ROMs directory folder.

 - For the emulator users, you need one that supports DLDi (see in the settings). Enable DLDi and set the sync folder to the folder where you have stored the game.

EDIT

I organized the source code like this:

	Assets: Folder where you can find sprites, backgrounds, apps and... other things, it's not organized and it's not supposed to be. (Some files are in .kra format, they need to be opened with an app called Krita)
	Backups: Dunno why this is here
	build: Folder created when compiling the program with Devkitpro. Contains files that could help (I'm not sure and I don't use this folder).
	nflib: Files for NFlib, the graphical library used to program on the DS. Needs to be here.
	nitrofiles: Here is the folder containing sprites and backgrounds I use, compiled with GRIT.
	source: Where the source code is.
	
Feel free to edit, and send me a message if you want your code to be implemented here. I'll credit you. (If you don't want to, please credit me if you share it on the internet)

Enjoy!

Rph.
